# myBall

Version 1 â€“ Week 2 Javascript Basics MIT XPro

* This is my initial submit of my Week 2 "Move Ball" assignment.  It has a very basic approach to making the balls move back and forth.  My intent is to refactor the code based on the skills that I acquire from my Full-Stack Development course at MIT Xpro.  If you have any suggestions and are willing to show me your abilities, please do.  I am willing to learn from how other coders think.
